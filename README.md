#Android-App-Development

Description:
Developing (Designing & Coding) my first ever App using Adobe XD and Android Studio.

Context:
A Polytechnic assignment: 
to design a Music Player App using Adobe XD software under the module 'User Experience and Interface Design' (UXID).
Then, create that App using Java on Android Studio - as close as possible - for the module 'Computational Thinking' (COMT).

Reflection:
With no prior experience to app designing or using music apps like Spotify, 
My app prototype/concept, MYSIC, was my purest level of app designing from scratch.
MYSIC went through many versions as it was relentlessly refined throughout
over 10 Usability Testers, stretched over the course of ~2 months.

Java and Android Studio had been an unpleasaning mix in general, especially when it is my first programming language.
It took me an intensive month to build the App. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to recreate the complete concept of MYSIC planned, as it was too ambitious for a Starter.
